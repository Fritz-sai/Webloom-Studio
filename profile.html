        <p class="about-description">
         As technology continues to shape our modern world, I’ve become increasingly inspired to pursue a career in the digital field. Currently, I am learning to become a web developer while studying at Clark College Science and Technology. This journey has been both challenging and exciting, filled with opportunities to grow, build, and explore the world of development.
        </p>
        <p class="about-description">
          I’ve had the chance to dive deeper into this world by learning programming languages such as HTML and CSS. These foundational skills have taught me not only how to structure and style a webpage but also how to bring it to life with interactivity and responsive design.
        </p>
        <p class="about-description">
          My goal is to become a professional web developer who can design and build modern websites and applications for businesses and organizations. I want to contribute to the digital future by creating tools that are both useful and engaging. I understand that this field is always evolving, and I’m committed to continuous learning—whether that’s diving into backend technologies, mastering frameworks like React, or understanding cybersecurity essentials.

                    <p>The website design of EliteMaterials is a stunning example of how luxury branding and intuitive user experience can be combined to create an impressive digital storefront. The homepage immediately captures attention with a hero section that features a sleek, high-performance Audi set against a scenic background.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, users can schedule a delivery using a date picker and even leave a note with specific instructions. The inclusion of three payment methods—Online Payment, Cash on Delivery, and POS on Delivery—ensures flexibility and convenience for all types of customers. On the right side of the page, the order summary displays selected products with images, names, and prices. Quantity controls for each item allow for easy editing before checkout.</p>

                    <p>This website is not perfect, but it represents growth. Every page, every button, and every animation is a reflection of persistence and learning through trial and error. The process taught me that failure is not a sign of weakness—it’s a crucial step in learning. It pushed me to understand the deeper principles of user experience and front-end development.</p>
                    <p>As I continue studying and building my skills, I am proud of what I have created. This site is more than just a project—it’s a symbol of how far I’ve come and a reminder that even in failure, there is progress. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but this journey has made me more confident in my path as a future web developer.</p>

                    <h2>Learning by Doing: My Growth Through Building Websites</h2>
                    <p>It all started with a simple idea and a single webpage I built in my small bedroom. With no team, no funding just passion and a laptop.I created the first version of my web development website by myself. I offered custom websites for small businesses, working late nights and learning every day.</p>
                    <p>As word spread about the quality of my work, more clients came in. What started as solo freelancing turned into a steady stream of projects. Soon, I couldn’t handle it alone—so I hired my first developer. Then a designer. Then a project manager.</p>
                    <p>Today, what began as a one-person effort has grown into a full-fledged web development company with a talented team. We now serve clients across industries, delivering beautiful, fast, and reliable websites—and I’m proud to say it all started with that one page I built on my own.</p>
